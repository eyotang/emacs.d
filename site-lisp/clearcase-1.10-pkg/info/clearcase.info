Clearcase Overview
******************

`clearcase' is a Configuration Management System of Rational Software
Corporation written by Kevin Esler <esler@rational.com>.

   The `clearcase' package described here supports ClearCase version
control from within the `XEmacs' editor.

  1.  Make sure you're using Gnu Emacs-20.4 or XEmacs-21.1 or later.

     Make sure that you DON'T load old versions of vc-hooks.el which
     contain incompatible versions of the tq package (functions
     tq-enqueue and friends). In particular, Bill Sommerfeld's VC/CC
     integration has this problem.

  2.  Insert this in your emacs startup file: (unless (noninteractive)
     (require 'clearcase))


   When you begin editing in any view-context, a ClearCase menu will
appear and ClearCase Minor Mode will be activated for you.
